            CRITICAL: You must FIRST use the analyze_dataset tool to read and analyze the actual dataset at {dataset_path} to understand its specific structure, columns, data types, and content.
            
            Use this command: analyze_dataset(file_path="{dataset_path}")
            
            After reading the dataset, coordinate a comprehensive multi-agent analysis:
            
            1. Dataset Assessment and Planning (based on actual dataset):
               - Read the dataset and understand its structure: {dataset_path}
               - Assess the dataset complexity and analysis requirements
               - Determine which agents are needed for this specific dataset
               - Create a detailed analysis plan based on the actual data
               - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
            
            2. Task Delegation Strategy (tailored to this dataset):
               - Delegate data cleaning to DataCleaner based on actual data quality issues
               - Assign transformation tasks to DataTransformer based on actual data structure
               - Coordinate analysis tasks with DataAnalyst based on actual data patterns
               - Plan summarization with DataSummarizer based on expected insights
               - Ensure proper sequencing and dependencies between tasks
            
            3. Quality Assurance Coordination (based on actual content):
               - Establish quality checkpoints for each agent's work
               - Define validation criteria based on the dataset domain
               - Plan cross-validation between agent outputs
               - Ensure consistency across all agent analyses
               - Monitor progress and adjust plans as needed
            
            4. Result Synthesis and Integration (tailored to the analysis):
               - Collect and integrate outputs from all agents
               - Resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies between agent findings
               - Create a unified analysis narrative
               - Ensure all insights are properly contextualized
               - Validate the completeness of the analysis
            
            5. Generate coordination report with:
               - Analysis plan and execution strategy
               - Task delegation details and rationale
               - Quality assurance measures implemented
               - Integration approach and synthesis methodology
               - Final comprehensive analysis results
               - Recommendations for future analysis workflows
            
            Return comprehensive coordination report with analysis plan, execution details, and integrated results from all agents.

        As an Analysis Coordinator, I need to:

        3. Coordinate the workflow and ensure proper sequencing
        4. Monitor progress and quality across all agents
        5. Synthesize results into a comprehensive final report
        
        My coordination capabilities include:
        - Multi-agent workflow design and management
        - Task decomposition and delegation
        - Quality assurance and validation
        - Result integration and synthesis
        - Project management and progress tracking
        - Stakeholder communication and reporting
        
        I will autonomously decide on the best coordination strategy based on the dataset characteristics and analysis requirements.
